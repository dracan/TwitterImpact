# Twitter Impact

I seem to spend my life scrolling through my Twitter feed, and thought it would be very useful to have aggregated data on which users filled up my timeline the most.

This is basically all this app does - it shows a list of the top 10 users that appear in your timeline over a period of time.

This is work in progress at the moment, but will be merging into the master branch for each release, and automatically deploying to an Azure website.
